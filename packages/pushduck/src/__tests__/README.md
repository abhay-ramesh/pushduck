## Architecture Validation

These tests validate the core architectural principles:

1. **Independence:** Each configuration is completely isolated
2. **No Global State Pollution:** Multiple configs don't interfere
3. **Memory Safety:** No memory leaks with many configurations
4. **Type Safety:** TypeScript types work correctly
5. **API Consistency:** Same API across all providers
6. **Error Isolation:** Errors in one config don't affect others
7. **Performance:** Acceptable performance with many configurations

## ‚úÖ All Phases Complete

1. **‚úÖ Multi-Config Independence:** Global state elimination and config-aware instances
2. **‚úÖ Router Config Isolation:** Router system with config dependency injection
