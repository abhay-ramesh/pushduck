# pushduck Test Suite

This test suite provides comprehensive coverage for the multi-configuration architecture implementation across all phases.

## Test Structure

### Phase 1: Global State Independence ‚úÖ (COMPLETE)

**File:** `phase-1-global-state.test.ts`

- **Status:** ‚úÖ PASSING - Phase 1 implementation is complete
- **Tests:** Multiple configuration independence, global state compatibility, memory management
- **Purpose:** Verifies that the core global state mutation fix works correctly

**Key Tests:**

- Multiple configurations don't interfere with each other
- S3 instances are independent objects
- Global state is set only for first configuration
- Configuration builder validation
- Memory leak prevention

### Phase 2: Router System with Config-Aware Instances ‚è≥ (PENDING)

**File:** `phase-2-router-system.test.ts`

- **Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY COMPLETE - Needs Phase 2 implementation
- **Tests:** Router independence, configuration isolation, middleware/hooks
- **Purpose:** Verifies routers use their own configuration instead of global state

**Key Tests:**

- Independent routers for different configurations
- Router configuration isolation for presigned URLs
- Middleware and hook independence
- Path configuration independence
- Type safety across configurations

### Phase 3: Storage Client with Config Parameters ‚è≥ (PENDING)

**File:** `phase-3-storage-client.test.ts`

- **Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY COMPLETE - Needs Phase 3 implementation  
- **Tests:** Storage instance independence, method isolation, API consistency
- **Purpose:** Verifies storage client functions use passed config instead of global

**Key Tests:**

- Independent storage instances
- Provider configuration isolation
- File operation independence
- Hook and error isolation
- API consistency across providers

### Integration Tests: End-to-End Multi-Configuration ‚úÖ

**File:** `integration-tests.test.ts`

- **Status:** ‚úÖ PASSING - Works with Phase 1 complete
- **Tests:** Real-world scenarios, complete workflows, error isolation
- **Purpose:** Verifies the entire system works together in realistic scenarios

**Key Scenarios:**

- E-commerce app with multiple providers (AWS + R2 + Minio)
- Multi-tenant architecture with regional isolation
- Development vs Production configurations
- Microservices architecture
- Migration scenarios
- Concurrent configuration creation
- Performance and memory testing

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 ‚úÖ (COMPLETE)

- [x] Multiple configurations are independent
- [x] Global state is not overwritten
- [x] S3 instances are config-aware
- [x] Memory leaks are prevented
- [x] Backward compatibility maintained

### Phase 2 ‚è≥ (PENDING)

- [ ] Routers use their own configuration
- [ ] Presigned URLs use correct provider settings
- [ ] Router middleware is isolated
- [ ] Path configuration works independently
- [ ] Type safety is maintained

### Phase 3 ‚è≥ (PENDING)

- [ ] Storage client functions accept config parameters
- [ ] File operations use correct provider
- [ ] Storage hooks are isolated
- [ ] Error handling is per-configuration
- [ ] API consistency across providers

### Integration ‚úÖ (WORKING)

- [x] Multi-provider workflows function correctly
- [x] Real-world scenarios work as expected
- [x] Error isolation between configurations
- [x] Performance is acceptable with many configs
- [x] Migration path is smooth

## Architecture Validation

These tests validate the core architectural principles:

1. **Independence:** Each configuration is completely isolated
2. **No Global State Pollution:** Multiple configs don't interfere
3. **Memory Safety:** No memory leaks with many configurations
4. **Type Safety:** TypeScript types work correctly
5. **API Consistency:** Same API across all providers
6. **Error Isolation:** Errors in one config don't affect others
7. **Performance:** Acceptable performance with many configurations

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Phase 2:** Update router system to be config-aware
2. **Implement Phase 3:** Update storage client functions to accept config
3. **Full Integration:** Ensure all phases work together seamlessly
4. **Performance Optimization:** Optimize for high-throughput scenarios
5. **Documentation:** Update API documentation with multi-config examples
