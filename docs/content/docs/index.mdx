## Simple S3 Uploads, Zero Vendor Lock-in

Upload files directly to S3-compatible storage. Lightweight (6KB), type-safe, and works everywhere. No monthly fees, no vendor lock-in—just **3 files and ~50 lines of code**.

```typescript
// Create your upload client
const upload = createUploadClient<AppRouter>({
  endpoint: '/api/upload'
});

// Use anywhere in your app
export function MyComponent() {
  const { uploadFiles, files, isUploading } = upload.imageUpload();

  return (
    <input
      type="file"
      onChange={(e) => uploadFiles(Array.from(e.target.files || []))}
      disabled={isUploading}
    />
  );
}
```
