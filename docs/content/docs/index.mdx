# Own Your File Uploads

_File uploads in Next.js have been overcomplicated for too long. Developers shouldn't need to cobble together multiple libraries, write custom middleware, and manage complex state just to handle file uploads. We believe the TypeScript ecosystem deserves better—hence, Next.js S3 Uploader._

**The most comprehensive file upload solution for Next.js.** Zero configuration, full TypeScript support, and everything you need out of the box.

```typescript
// It's really this simple
const upload = createUploadClient();

export function MyComponent() {
  const { uploadFiles, uploadedFiles, isUploading } = upload.imageUpload();

  return (
    <input
      type="file"
      onChange={(e) => uploadFiles(e.target.files)}
      disabled={isUploading}
    />
  );
}
```

## Why Next.js S3 Uploader?

File uploads should be **simple**, **secure**, and **scalable**. Other solutions make you choose between ease of use and control, or require vendor lock-in and ongoing costs.

Next.js S3 Uploader gives you:

- **Full ownership** of your upload infrastructure
- **Zero vendor lock-in** with provider-agnostic design
- **Production-grade features** without the complexity
- **Type-safe development** with full TypeScript inference
- **Community-driven** with real-world usage patterns

## Get Started in 2 Minutes

<Steps>

<Step>

### Install the package

```bash
npm install next-s3-uploader
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Create your upload router

```typescript
// app/api/s3-upload/route.ts
import { createS3Router } from "next-s3-uploader/server";

const router = createS3Router({
  imageUpload: s3.image().maxSize("10MB").accept([".jpg", ".png"]),
});

export { router as POST };
export type Router = typeof router;
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Use in your components

```typescript
// components/image-upload.tsx
import { createUploadClient } from "next-s3-uploader";
import type { Router } from "../app/api/s3-upload/route";

const upload = createUploadClient<Router>();

export function ImageUpload() {
  const { uploadFiles, uploadedFiles, isUploading } = upload.imageUpload();

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="file"
        onChange={(e) => uploadFiles(e.target.files)}
        disabled={isUploading}
      />
      {uploadedFiles.map((file) => (
        <img key={file.key} src={file.url} alt="Uploaded" />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

</Step>

</Steps>

**🎉 That's it!** You now have production-ready file uploads with progress tracking, validation, and TypeScript inference.
