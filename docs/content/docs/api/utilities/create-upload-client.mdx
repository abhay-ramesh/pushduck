# createUploadClient

Creates a type-safe upload client that provides property-based access to your upload endpoints with full TypeScript inference.

<Callout type="success">
  **Recommended Approach**: This is the preferred way to handle uploads in your React components. It provides enhanced developer experience with property-based access and centralized configuration.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  This utility function provides property-based access to your upload routes. You can also use the `useUploadRoute<AppRouter>()` hook if you prefer traditional React patterns.
</Callout>

## Benefits of This Approach

The structured client approach offers these advantages:

- **🎯 Type Safety**: Complete inference from server router to client
- **🔍 IntelliSense**: See all available endpoints with autocomplete
- **🛡️ Refactoring Safety**: Rename routes confidently across your codebase
- **🚫 No String Literals**: Property-based access eliminates typos
- **⚡ Centralized Config**: Set up headers, timeouts, and options once

## Function Signature

```typescript
function createUploadClient<TRouter>(
  options: ClientOptions
): UploadClient<TRouter>;
```

## Parameters

<TypeTable
  type={{
    endpoint: {
      description: "API endpoint URL for your upload router",
      type: "string",
      required: true,
    },
    headers: {
      description: "Custom headers to include with requests",
      type: "Record<string, string>",
    },
    timeout: {
      description: "Request timeout in milliseconds",
      type: "number",
      default: "30000",
    },
    retries: {
      description: "Number of retry attempts",
      type: "number",
      default: "3",
    },
  }}
/>

## Return Type

The function returns an upload client with property-based access to your router endpoints:

```typescript
type UploadClient<TRouter> = {
  [K in keyof TRouter]: {
    uploadFiles: (
      files: File[],
      options?: UploadOptions
    ) => Promise<UploadResult[]>;
    files: UploadFile[];
    isUploading: boolean;
    reset: () => void;
  };
};
```

## Usage Examples

<Tabs items={["Basic", "Advanced", "With Authentication"]}>
  <Tab value="Basic">
    ```typescript
    import { createUploadClient } from 'pushduck/client'
    import type { AppRouter } from '@/lib/upload'

    export const upload = createUploadClient<AppRouter>({
      endpoint: '/api/upload'
    })

    // Property-based access with full type safety
    const { uploadFiles, files } = upload.imageUpload
    ```

  </Tab>
  
  <Tab value="Advanced">
    ```typescript
    export const upload = createUploadClient<AppRouter>({
      endpoint: '/api/upload',
      timeout: 60000,
      retries: 5,
      headers: {
        'X-Client-Version': '1.0.0'
      },
      onProgress: (progress) => {
        console.log(`Global progress: ${progress.percentage}%`)
      }
    })
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab value="With Authentication">
    ```typescript
    export const upload = createUploadClient<AppRouter>({
      endpoint: '/api/upload',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${getAuthToken()}`
      },
      onError: (error) => {
        if (error.status === 401) {
          redirectToLogin()
        }
      }
    })
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="success">
  **Type Safety:** The client automatically infers all available endpoints from
  your router type, providing compile-time validation and autocomplete.
</Callout>{" "}
