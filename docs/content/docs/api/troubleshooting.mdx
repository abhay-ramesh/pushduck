Common issues and solutions when using pushduck.

## Development Issues

### Next.js Turbo Mode Compatibility

<Callout type="warn">
**Known Issue:** pushduck has compatibility issues with Next.js Turbo mode (`--turbo` flag).
</Callout>

**Problem:** Uploads fail or behave unexpectedly when using `next dev --turbo`.

**Solution:** Remove the `--turbo` flag from your development script:

<Tabs items={["package.json", "Command Line"]}>
  <Tab value="package.json">
    ```json
    {
      "scripts": {
        // ❌ This may cause issues
        "dev": "next dev --turbo",
        
        // ✅ Use this instead
        "dev": "next dev"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab value="Command Line">
    ```bash
    # ❌ This may cause issues
    npm run dev --turbo
    
    # ✅ Use this instead
    npm run dev
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Why this happens:** Turbo mode's aggressive caching and bundling can interfere with the upload process, particularly with presigned URL generation and file streaming.

## Upload Failures

### CORS Errors

**Problem:** Browser console shows CORS errors when uploading files.

**Symptoms:**
```
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/...' 
from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy
```

**Solution:** Configure CORS on your S3 bucket. See the [provider setup guides](/docs/providers) for detailed CORS configuration.

### Environment Variables Not Found

**Problem:** Errors about missing environment variables.

**Symptoms:**
```
Error: Environment variable CLOUDFLARE_R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID is not defined
```

**Solution:** Ensure your environment variables are properly set:

1. **Check your `.env.local` file exists** in your project root
2. **Verify variable names** match exactly (case-sensitive)
3. **Restart your development server** after adding new variables

```bash
# .env.local
CLOUDFLARE_R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
CLOUDFLARE_R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
CLOUDFLARE_R2_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id
R2_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
```

### File Size Limits

**Problem:** Large files fail to upload.

**Solution:** Check and adjust size limits:

```typescript
// app/api/upload/route.ts
const uploadRouter = s3.createRouter({
  imageUpload: s3
    .image()
    .max("10MB") // Increase as needed
    .formats(["jpeg", "png", "webp"]),
});
```

## Type Errors

### TypeScript Inference Issues

**Problem:** TypeScript errors with upload client.

**Solution:** Ensure proper type exports:

```typescript
// app/api/upload/route.ts
export const { GET, POST } = createS3Handler(uploadRouter);
export type AppRouter = typeof uploadRouter; // ✅ Export the type

// lib/upload-client.ts
import type { AppRouter } from "@/app/api/upload/route";

export const upload = createUploadClient<AppRouter>({ // ✅ Use the type
  endpoint: "/api/upload",
});
```

## Performance Issues

### Slow Upload Speeds

**Problem:** Uploads are slower than expected.

**Solutions:**

1. **Choose the right provider region** close to your users
2. **Check your internet connection** and server resources
3. **Consider your provider's performance characteristics**

### Memory Issues with Large Files

**Problem:** Browser crashes or high memory usage with large files.

**Solution:** File streaming is handled automatically by pushduck:

```typescript
// File streaming is handled automatically
// No additional configuration needed
const { uploadFiles } = upload.fileUpload();
await uploadFiles(largeFiles); // ✅ Streams automatically
```

## Getting Help

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. **Check the documentation** for your specific provider
2. **Enable debug logging** by setting `NODE_ENV=development`
3. **Check browser console** for detailed error messages
4. **Verify your provider configuration** is correct
