# Production Checklist

Ensure your file upload system is production-ready with this comprehensive checklist.

<Callout type="warning">
  **Critical:** Never deploy file upload functionality to production without
  proper security, monitoring, and error handling. Follow this checklist to
  avoid common pitfalls.
</Callout>

## Security Checklist

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Authentication & Authorization**
    
    - [ ] Authentication middleware is implemented on all upload routes
    - [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC) is configured
    - [ ] API endpoints are protected with proper authorization
    - [ ] Test authentication flows work correctly
    
    ```typescript
    // ✅ Secure endpoint
    import { s3 } from "@/lib/upload";
    
    const s3Router = s3.createRouter({
      userFiles: s3.image()
        .max("5MB")
        .count(10)
        .middleware(async ({ req, metadata }) => {
          const session = await getServerSession(req)
          if (!session) throw new Error("Authentication required")
          return { ...metadata, userId: session.user.id }
        })
    })
