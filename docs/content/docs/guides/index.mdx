## Common Patterns

### Basic Upload Flow

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **Configure Server Router**
    
    Set up your upload routes with validation:
    
    ```typescript
    const uploadRouter = createS3Router({
      routes: {
        imageUpload: s3.image().maxFileSize("5MB"),
        documentUpload: s3.file().maxFileSize("10MB"),
      },
    });
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Implement Client Upload**
    
    Use hooks or client for reactive uploads:
    
    ```typescript
    const { upload, uploading, progress } = useUpload({
      endpoint: '/api/upload',
      route: 'imageUpload',
    });
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step>
    **Handle Upload Results**
    
    Process successful uploads and errors:
    
    ```typescript
    const result = await upload(file);
    console.log('File uploaded:', result.url);
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Authentication Pattern

```typescript
// Server: Add authentication middleware
const uploadRouter = createS3Router({
  middleware: [
    async (req) => {
      const user = await authenticate(req);
      if (!user) throw new Error('Unauthorized');
      return { user };
    }
  ],
  routes: {
    userAvatar: s3.image()
      .maxFileSize("2MB")
      .path(({ metadata }) => `avatars/${metadata.user.id}`),
  },
});

// Client: Include auth headers
const { upload } = useUpload({
  endpoint: '/api/upload',
  route: 'userAvatar',
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
  },
});
```

## Architecture Patterns

### Multi-Provider Setup

```typescript
// Support multiple storage providers
const uploadRouter = createS3Router({
  storage: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' 
    ? { provider: 'aws-s3', ... }
    : { provider: 'minio', ... },
  routes: {
    // Your routes remain the same
  },
});
```

### Route-Based Organization

```typescript
const uploadRouter = createS3Router({
  routes: {
    // Public uploads
    publicImages: s3.image().maxFileSize("5MB").public(),
    
    // User-specific uploads
    userDocuments: s3.file()
      .maxFileSize("10MB")
      .path(({ metadata }) => `users/${metadata.userId}/documents`),
      
    // Admin uploads
    adminAssets: s3.file()
      .maxFileSize("50MB")
      .middleware([requireAdmin]),
  },
});
```

## Performance Tips

<Callout type="tip">
  **Optimization Strategies**:
  - Use appropriate file size limits for your use case
  - Implement client-side validation before upload
  - Consider using presigned URLs for large files
  - Enable CDN for frequently accessed files
  - Implement progressive upload for large files
