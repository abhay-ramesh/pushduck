# Roadmap

Our mission is simple: **make file uploads in Next.js as straightforward as they should be**. We're building the most developer-friendly, type-safe, and production-ready file upload solution for the TypeScript ecosystem.

<Callout type="info">
  This roadmap is community-driven. **Your feedback shapes our priorities.**
  Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/pushduck) or open an issue on
  [GitHub](https://github.com/abhay-ramesh/pushduck) to influence what we
  build next.
</Callout>

## Current Status

We've already solved the core problems that have frustrated developers for years:

‚úÖ **Zero Configuration** - Works out of the box with sensible defaults  
‚úÖ **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript inference for upload schemas  
‚úÖ **Multiple Providers** - Cloudflare R2, AWS S3, Google Cloud, and more  
‚úÖ **Production Ready** - Used by teams processing millions of uploads  
‚úÖ **Developer Experience** - Property-based client access with enhanced IntelliSense

## What's Next

## Behind the Scenes

### What We're Working on Right Now

**Week of January 15, 2024:**

- üî® Enhanced type inference for nested upload schemas
- üß™ Testing framework for upload workflows
- üìö Interactive examples in documentation
- üêõ Bug fixes for edge cases in multi-part uploads

<Callout type="info">
  Follow our [GitHub project
  board](https://github.com/abhay-ramesh/pushduck/projects) for real-time
  updates on development progress.

### Development Structure

Our development process is organized around clear modules:

<Files>
  <Folder name="packages" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="pushduck">
      <Folder name="src">
        <Folder name="client">
          <File name="upload-client.ts" />
          <File name="hooks.ts" />
        </Folder>
        <Folder name="server">
          <File name="router.ts" />
          <File name="providers.ts" />
        </Folder>
        <Folder name="types">
          <File name="index.ts" />
        </Folder>
      </Folder>
    </Folder>
    <Folder name="cli">
      <File name="index.ts" />
      <File name="templates/" />
    </Folder>

      <File name="vue/" />
      <File name="svelte/" />
      <File name="react-native/" />
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
</Files>

### Core Principles

As we build new features, we never compromise on:

- **Type Safety First** - Every feature must have full TypeScript support
- **Zero Breaking Changes** - Backward compatibility is non-negotiable
- **Performance by Default** - New features can't slow down existing workflows
- **Developer Happiness** - If it's not delightful to use, we rebuild it

## Get Involved
