## Development Roadmap

Our mission is to make file uploads **simple**, **secure**, and **scalable** for every developer and every use case.

## ‚úÖ Completed

### Core Foundation
‚úÖ **Universal Compatibility** - Works with 16+ frameworks and edge runtimes  
‚úÖ **Type-Safe APIs** - Full TypeScript inference from server to client  
‚úÖ **Multi-Provider Support** - AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, DigitalOcean Spaces, MinIO  
‚úÖ **Production Security** - Presigned URLs, file validation, CORS handling  
‚úÖ **Developer Experience** - Property-based client, comprehensive error handling  
‚úÖ **Overall Progress Tracking** - Now provides real-time aggregate progress metrics
- `progress` - 0-100% completion across all files
- `uploadSpeed` - Combined transfer rate in bytes/second  
- `eta` - Overall time remaining in seconds

### Setup & Tooling
‚úÖ **Interactive CLI** - Guided setup with smart defaults and auto-detection  
‚úÖ **Code Generation** - Type-safe API routes and client components  
‚úÖ **Framework Detection** - Automatic Next.js App Router/Pages Router detection  
‚úÖ **Environment Setup** - Automated credential configuration  

### Documentation & Examples
‚úÖ **Comprehensive Docs** - Complete API reference and integration guides  
‚úÖ **Live Examples** - Working demos for all supported frameworks  
‚úÖ **Migration Guides** - Step-by-step migration from other solutions  
‚úÖ **Best Practices** - Security, performance, and architecture guidance  

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations

### Progress Tracking Constraints
‚úÖ **Overall Progress Tracking** - Now provides real-time aggregate progress metrics
- `progress` - 0-100% completion across all files
- `uploadSpeed` - Combined transfer rate in bytes/second  
- `eta` - Overall time remaining in seconds

### Upload Control Limitations
Current upload management has constraints for handling real-world scenarios.

**The following features are NOT yet implemented but are planned for Q3 2025:**

‚ùå **No Resumable Uploads** - Cannot resume interrupted uploads from where they left off  
‚ùå **No Pausable Uploads** - Cannot pause ongoing uploads and resume later  
‚ùå **No Cancel Support** - Cannot cancel individual uploads in progress  
‚ùå **Limited Network Resilience** - No automatic retry on network failures or connection switching  

These features are actively being designed and will be released based on community feedback and use case requirements.

## üöß In Progress

### Developer Experience
üöß **Enhanced Error Messages** - Contextual help and troubleshooting suggestions  
üöß **Testing Utilities** - Mock S3 providers and testing helpers for CI/CD  
üöß **Performance Profiling** - Debugging hooks for upload performance analysis  

## üìã Planned

### Q3 2025 - Core Upload Features
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Hook APIs** - onProgress callbacks and advanced upload state management (with `onStart` lifecycle)
- **Advanced Upload Control** - Resumable, pausable uploads with cancel support and network resilience
- **Upload Queue Management** - Concurrent upload limits, prioritization, and bandwidth throttling
- **Chunk Upload Optimization** - Configurable chunk sizes and parallel chunk uploads for large files
- **Better Error Recovery** - Automatic retry with exponential backoff and network change detection

### Q4 2025 - Framework Support
- **Mobile SDKs** - React Native and Expo support for mobile apps
- **Additional Framework Adapters** - Astro, Qwik, Solid.js, and Fresh
- **Testing Framework** - Built-in test utilities and mock providers
- **Migration Tools** - Automated migration from uploadthing, uppy, and other libraries

### Q1 2026 - Developer Experience
- **Enhanced TypeScript** - Better type inference and IDE support
- **Plugin System** - Hooks-based extension system for custom upload logic
- **Debug Mode** - Detailed logging and upload lifecycle visualization
- **Performance Monitoring Hooks** - Metrics collection for custom analytics integration

### Q2 2026 - Integration Ecosystem
- **Integration Guides** - Documented patterns for Sharp, FFmpeg, Cloudflare Images, etc.
- **Example Applications** - Production-ready examples for common use cases
- **Community Adapters** - Framework adapters maintained by the community
- **Best Practices Library** - Shared configurations and patterns

## üéØ Long-term Vision

### Stay Focused, Stay Lightweight

Pushduck will remain a **focused upload library**, not a platform. Our mission:

> "The fastest, most lightweight way to add S3 file uploads to any web application"

**What we'll always prioritize:**
- ü™∂ **Minimal bundle size** - Keep dependencies light
- üéØ **Core upload features** - Do one thing exceptionally well  
- üîß **Extensibility** - Provide hooks, not built-in features for everything
- üìö **Integration guides** - Document how to integrate with other tools
- üåç **Universal compatibility** - Work everywhere JavaScript runs

**What we won't build:**
- ‚ùå File processing (use Sharp, FFmpeg, etc.)
- ‚ùå Content moderation (use Cloudflare, AWS services)
- ‚ùå Analytics dashboards (provide hooks for your analytics)
- ‚ùå Team management (that's your app's concern)
- ‚ùå Platform features (we're a library, not a SaaS)

## Community Feedback

### What We're Hearing From You

Based on community feedback, GitHub issues, and Discord discussions, here are the most requested **in-scope** features:

**üî• High Priority:**
- ‚úÖ **Upload Resume & Retry** - Automatic retry and resume for failed uploads (Q3 2025)
- **Better Error Messages** - More helpful error descriptions with suggested fixes
- **Queue Management** - Control concurrent uploads and bandwidth throttling
- **Progress Customization** - More granular progress tracking hooks
- **Example Library** - More real-world examples and integration patterns

**üí≠ Under Discussion:**
- **GraphQL Integration** - Native GraphQL subscription support for upload progress
- **Webhook Support** - Custom webhook configuration for upload lifecycle events
- **Component Library** - Headless UI components for common upload patterns
- **Performance Profiling** - Built-in profiling tools for debugging upload issues

**Out of Scope:**
We won't build features like file processing (use Sharp/FFmpeg), content moderation (use specialized services), or platform features (team management, dashboards). We're staying focused as a lightweight upload library.

## How We Prioritize

Our roadmap is driven by three key factors:

1. **Community Impact** - Features that solve real problems for the most developers
2. **Technical Excellence** - Maintaining our high standards for type safety and DX
3. **Ecosystem Health** - Building a sustainable, long-term solution

## Development Principles

As we build new features, we never compromise on:

- **ü™∂ Lightweight First** - Bundle size is a feature, not an afterthought
- **üéØ Focused Scope** - Do one thing (uploads) exceptionally well
- **üìò Type Safety** - Every feature must have full TypeScript support
- **üîÑ Zero Breaking Changes** - Backward compatibility is non-negotiable
- **‚ö° Performance** - New features can't slow down existing workflows
- **üîå Extensibility** - Provide hooks, not built-in everything
