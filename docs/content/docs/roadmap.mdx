# Roadmap

Our mission is to make file uploads **simple**, **secure**, and **scalable** for every developer and every use case.

## ‚úÖ Completed

### Core Foundation
‚úÖ **Universal Compatibility** - Works with 16+ frameworks and edge runtimes  
‚úÖ **Type-Safe APIs** - Full TypeScript inference from server to client  
‚úÖ **Multi-Provider Support** - AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, DigitalOcean Spaces, MinIO  
‚úÖ **Production Security** - Presigned URLs, file validation, CORS handling  
‚úÖ **Developer Experience** - Property-based client, comprehensive error handling  
‚úÖ **Overall Progress Tracking** - Now provides real-time aggregate progress metrics
- `progress` - 0-100% completion across all files
- `uploadSpeed` - Combined transfer rate in bytes/second  
- `eta` - Overall time remaining in seconds

### Setup & Tooling
‚úÖ **Interactive CLI** - Guided setup with smart defaults and auto-detection  
‚úÖ **Code Generation** - Type-safe API routes and client components  
‚úÖ **Framework Detection** - Automatic Next.js App Router/Pages Router detection  
‚úÖ **Environment Setup** - Automated credential configuration  

### Documentation & Examples
‚úÖ **Comprehensive Docs** - Complete API reference and integration guides  
‚úÖ **Live Examples** - Working demos for all supported frameworks  
‚úÖ **Migration Guides** - Step-by-step migration from other solutions  
‚úÖ **Best Practices** - Security, performance, and architecture guidance  

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations

### Progress Tracking Constraints
‚úÖ **Overall Progress Tracking** - Now provides real-time aggregate progress metrics
- `progress` - 0-100% completion across all files
- `uploadSpeed` - Combined transfer rate in bytes/second  
- `eta` - Overall time remaining in seconds

### Upload Control Limitations
Current upload management has constraints for handling real-world scenarios:

‚ùå **No Resumable Uploads** - Cannot resume interrupted uploads from where they left off  
‚ùå **No Pausable Uploads** - Cannot pause ongoing uploads and resume later  
‚ùå **No Cancel Support** - Cannot cancel individual uploads in progress  
‚ùå **Limited Network Resilience** - No automatic retry on network failures or connection switching  

These limitations may be addressed in future releases based on community feedback and use case requirements.

## Behind the Scenes

### What We're Working on Right Now

**Week of June 23, 2025:**

- üî® Enhanced type inference for nested upload schemas
- üß™ Testing framework for upload workflows
- üìö Interactive examples in documentation
- üêõ Bug fixes for edge cases in multi-part uploads

<Callout type="info">
  Follow our [GitHub project
  board](https://github.com/abhay-ramesh/pushduck/projects) for real-time
  updates on development progress.
</Callout>

### Development Structure

Our development process is organized around clear modules:

<Files>
  <Folder name="packages" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="pushduck">
      <Folder name="src">
        <Folder name="client">
          <File name="upload-client.ts" />
          <File name="hooks.ts" />
        </Folder>
        <Folder name="server">
          <File name="router.ts" />
          <File name="providers.ts" />
        </Folder>
        <Folder name="types">
          <File name="index.ts" />
        </Folder>
      </Folder>
    </Folder>
    <Folder name="cli">
      <File name="index.ts" />
      <File name="templates/" />
    </Folder>

      <File name="vue/" />
      <File name="svelte/" />
      <File name="react-native/" />
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
</Files>

### Core Principles

As we build new features, we never compromise on:

- **Type Safety First** - Every feature must have full TypeScript support
- **Zero Breaking Changes** - Backward compatibility is non-negotiable
- **Performance by Default** - New features can't slow down existing workflows
- **Developer Happiness** - If it's not delightful to use, we rebuild it

## Get Involved

This roadmap exists because of developers like you. Here's how to shape the future:

### For Users
