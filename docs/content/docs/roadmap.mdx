# Roadmap

Our mission is simple: **make file uploads in Next.js as straightforward as they should be**. We're building the most developer-friendly, type-safe, and production-ready file upload solution for the TypeScript ecosystem.

<Callout type="info">
  This roadmap is community-driven. **Your feedback shapes our priorities.**
  Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/nextjs-s3-uploader) or open an issue on
  [GitHub](https://github.com/your-org/next-s3-uploader) to influence what we
  build next.

## Current Status

We've already solved the core problems that have frustrated developers for years:

‚úÖ **Zero Configuration** - Works out of the box with sensible defaults  
‚úÖ **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript inference for upload schemas  
‚úÖ **Multiple Providers** - AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, Google Cloud, and more  
‚úÖ **Production Ready** - Used by teams processing millions of uploads  
‚úÖ **Developer Experience** - Property-based client access with enhanced IntelliSense

### Core Principles

As we build new features, we never compromise on:

- **Type Safety First** - Every feature must have full TypeScript support
- **Zero Breaking Changes** - Backward compatibility is non-negotiable
- **Performance by Default** - New features can't slow down existing workflows
- **Developer Happiness** - If it's not delightful to use, we rebuild it
