  </Tab>

  <Tab value="Implementation Complexity">
    ### What AWS SDK Requires You to Build

    With AWS SDK, you need to **manually implement everything**:

    #### 1. Presigned URL Generation
    ```typescript
    import { S3Client, PutObjectCommand } from '@aws-sdk/client-s3';
    import { getSignedUrl } from '@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner';

    // ❌ You must handle:
    // - Creating S3 client with credentials
    // - Generating unique file keys
    // - Setting correct content types
    // - Configuring expiration times
    // - Handling CORS headers
    // - Managing bucket permissions

    const s3Client = new S3Client({ region: 'us-east-1' });

    const generatePresignedUrl = async (fileName: string) => {
      const key = `uploads/${Date.now()}-${fileName}`;
      const command = new PutObjectCommand({
        Bucket: 'my-bucket',
        Key: key,
        ContentType: 'application/octet-stream', // Must set manually
      });
      
      const url = await getSignedUrl(s3Client, command, { expiresIn: 3600 });
      return { url, key };
    };
    ```

    #### 2. Client-Side Upload Logic
    ```typescript
    // ❌ You must build:
    // - XMLHttpRequest wrapper for progress tracking
    // - Error handling and retry logic
    // - AbortController for cancellation
    // - State management for multiple files
    // - Progress aggregation
    // - File validation (size, type)

    const uploadFile = (file: File, presignedUrl: string) => {
      return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
        
        xhr.upload.onprogress = (e) => {
          const progress = (e.loaded / e.total) * 100;
          // Update UI manually
        };
        
        xhr.onload = () => {
          if (xhr.status === 200) {
            resolve(xhr.response);
          } else {
            reject(new Error('Upload failed'));
          }
        };
        
        xhr.onerror = () => reject(new Error('Network error'));
        
        xhr.open('PUT', presignedUrl);
        xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-Type', file.type);
        xhr.send(file);
      });
    };
    ```

    #### 3. API Route Handler
    ```typescript
    // ❌ You must implement:
    // - Request parsing and validation
    // - Authentication/authorization
    // - File metadata validation
    // - Error responses
    // - Type safety

    export async function POST(request: Request) {
      const { fileName, fileSize, fileType } = await request.json();
      
      // Validate manually
      if (fileSize > 10 * 1024 * 1024) {
        return Response.json({ error: 'File too large' }, { status: 400 });
      }
      
      // Auth manually
      const user = await authenticateUser(request);
      if (!user) {
        return Response.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 });
      }
      
      // Generate presigned URL
      const { url, key } = await generatePresignedUrl(fileName);
      
      return Response.json({ url, key });
    }
    ```

    #### 4. React Component State Management
    ```typescript
    // ❌ You must manage:
    // - File state (idle, uploading, success, error)
    // - Progress for each file
    // - Overall progress
    // - Error messages
    // - Upload speed and ETA calculations
    // - Cleanup on unmount

    const [files, setFiles] = useState<FileState[]>([]);
    const [isUploading, setIsUploading] = useState(false);
    const [progress, setProgress] = useState(0);
    const [errors, setErrors] = useState<string[]>([]);
    
    // Implement all the upload logic...
    ```

    #### 5. CORS Configuration
    ```json
    // ❌ You must configure S3 bucket CORS manually:
    {
      "CORSRules": [
        {
          "AllowedOrigins": ["https://your-domain.com"],
          "AllowedMethods": ["PUT", "POST", "GET"],
          "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
          "ExposeHeaders": ["ETag"]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

## Migration Guide

### From AWS SDK to Pushduck

```typescript
// Before (AWS SDK)
import { S3Client, PutObjectCommand } from '@aws-sdk/client-s3';

const s3 = new S3Client({ region: 'us-east-1' });

const uploadFile = async (file: File) => {
  const command = new PutObjectCommand({
    Bucket: 'my-bucket',
    Key: `uploads/${file.name}`,
    Body: await file.arrayBuffer(),
  });
  await s3.send(command);
};

// After (Pushduck)
// Server
const { s3 } = createUploadConfig()
  .provider('aws', { bucket: 'my-bucket', region: 'us-east-1' })
  .build();

const router = s3.createRouter({
  fileUpload: s3.file().maxFileSize('10MB'),
});

export const { GET, POST } = router.handlers;

// Client
const { uploadFiles } = useUploadRoute('fileUpload');
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ 31x smaller bundle (~16KB vs ~500KB)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### "Should I use Pushduck or a managed service?"

**Use Pushduck if:**
- You want full control and ownership
- You want to minimize costs
- You're comfortable with basic S3 setup

**Use managed service if:**
- You want zero infrastructure setup
- You need built-in processing (images, videos)
- You have budget for convenience

---

### "Is Pushduck production-ready?"

✅ Yes! Pushduck is used in production by multiple projects.

**Production features:**
- Comprehensive error handling

### "Can I migrate from Pushduck later?"

✅ Yes, easily! Your files are in standard S3 buckets.

**Migration path:**
1. Your files are already in S3 (standard format)
2. Switch to any S3-compatible solution
3. No data migration needed (files stay in your bucket)
4. No vendor lock-in

### "Does Pushduck support image processing?"

⚠️ **Not built-in** (by design - keeps bundle small).

**Integration options:**
- [Sharp](/docs/guides/image-uploads) - Server-side processing
- [Cloudinary](/docs/guides/image-uploads) - API-based
- [Imgix](/docs/guides/image-uploads) - URL-based
- Any image processing tool

See: [Image Uploads Guide](/docs/guides/image-uploads)

## Conclusion

**Pushduck** is ideal for developers who want:
- 🪶 Lightweight library (~16KB)
- 🔒 Full control over storage
- 💰 Minimal costs (S3 only)
- 🚀 Edge runtime support
- 🔌 No vendor lock-in

If you need a managed service with built-in processing and global CDN, consider **Uploadcare** or **Filestack**.

If you want rapid prototyping with zero S3 setup, consider **UploadThing**.

For advanced S3 features and AWS-only projects, **AWS SDK** is the right choice.

For rich UI components and resumable uploads, **Uppy** is a great option.
