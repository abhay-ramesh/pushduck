<Callout type="success">
  **🚀 New!** Use our CLI for instant setup: `npx @pushduck/cli@latest init` - handles everything automatically!
</Callout>
    
### ⚡ Interactive CLI Setup
    
Get everything set up instantly with our interactive CLI:


```npm
npx @pushduck/cli@latest init

- ✅ Set up your chosen provider (Cloudflare R2, AWS S3, etc.)
- ✅ Create API routes with type safety
- ✅ Generate example components
- ✅ Configure environment variables
- ✅ Create and configure your storage bucket

**What you get:**
- Production-ready upload API in `app/api/upload/route.ts`

## Step-by-Step CLI Walkthrough

Here's exactly what happens when you run the CLI and how to make the best choices:

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Project Detection & Validation
    
    ```
    🔍 Detecting your project...
      ✓ Next.js App Router detected
      ✓ TypeScript configuration found
      ✓ Package manager: pnpm detected
      ✓ No existing upload configuration
      ✓ Project structure validated
    ```
    
    **What's happening:** The CLI automatically detects your project setup to ensure compatibility.
    
    **If you see warnings:**
    - ⚠️ **Pages Router detected**: Still works, but examples will be for App Router
    - ⚠️ **No TypeScript**: JavaScript examples will be generated instead
    - ⚠️ **Existing configuration**: CLI will ask if you want to overwrite
    - ⚠️ **Package manager not detected**: Will default to npm
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Provider Selection
    
    ```
    ? Which cloud storage provider would you like to use?
    ❯ Cloudflare R2 (recommended)
      AWS S3 (classic, widely supported)
      DigitalOcean Spaces (simple, affordable)
      Google Cloud Storage (enterprise-grade)
      MinIO (self-hosted, open source)
      Custom S3-compatible endpoint
    ```
    
    **How to choose:**
    
    <Tabs items={["First Time?", "Cost Conscious", "Global Users", "Enterprise"]}>
      <Tab value="First Time?">
        **Choose: Cloudflare R2 (recommended)**
        - Zero egress fees (bandwidth is FREE)
        - Global edge network with 200+ locations
        - Simple setup with excellent documentation
        - Best performance for most applications
      </Tab>
      
      <Tab value="Cost Conscious">
        **Choose: Cloudflare R2**
        - No egress fees (bandwidth is free)
        - $0.015/GB storage (cheaper than S3)
        - Global edge network included
        - Perfect for high-traffic applications
      </Tab>
      
      <Tab value="Global Users">
        **Choose: Cloudflare R2**
        - Global edge network with 200+ locations
        - Automatic geographic distribution
        - Faster uploads worldwide
        - Built-in CDN functionality
      </Tab>
      
      <Tab value="Enterprise">
        **Choose: Google Cloud Storage**
        - Enterprise-grade security and compliance
        - Advanced analytics and monitoring
        - Integration with Google Cloud ecosystem
        - Multi-region redundancy options
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
    
    **Use arrow keys** to navigate, **Enter** to select.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Credential Detection & Setup
    
    ```
    🔧 Setting up Cloudflare R2...
    
    🔍 Checking for existing credentials...
      ✓ Found CLOUDFLARE_R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID
      ✓ Found CLOUDFLARE_R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
      ✓ Found CLOUDFLARE_R2_ACCOUNT_ID
      ⚠ CLOUDFLARE_R2_BUCKET_NAME not found
    ```
    
    **What this means:**
    - ✅ **Found credentials**: CLI detected existing environment variables
    - ⚠️ **Missing credentials**: You'll be prompted to enter them
    - ❌ **No credentials**: CLI will guide you through setup
    
    **If prompted for credentials:**
    ```
    ? Enter your Cloudflare R2 Access Key ID: f1d2...
    ? Enter your Cloudflare R2 Secret Access Key: [hidden]
    ? Enter your Cloudflare Account ID: abc123...
    ? Enter your R2 bucket name: my-app-uploads-2024
    ```
    
    **Pro tips:**
    - Use a **unique bucket name** (globally unique across all R2)
    - **Account ID** can be found in your Cloudflare dashboard
    - **Don't have credentials?** Check our [Cloudflare R2 setup guide](/docs/providers/cloudflare-r2)
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Bucket Creation
    
    ```
    ? Create bucket automatically? (Y/n)
    ```
    
    **Recommended: Yes** - The CLI will:
    - Create the bucket with proper permissions
    - Set up CORS configuration for web uploads
    - Configure public read access for uploaded files
    - Test the connection to ensure everything works
    
    **Choose "No" if:**
    - You already have a bucket configured
    - Your organization requires manual bucket creation
    - You need custom bucket policies
    
    **Success looks like:**
    ```
    ✅ Created R2 bucket: my-app-uploads-2024
    ✅ Configured CORS for web uploads
    ✅ Set up public read permissions
    ✅ Connection test successful
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### API Route Configuration
    
    ```
    ? Where should we create the upload API?
    ❯ app/api/upload/route.ts (recommended)
      app/api/s3-upload/route.ts (classic)
      Custom path
    ```
    
    **Recommendations:**
    - **`/api/upload`**: Clean, modern route name
    - **`/api/s3-upload`**: If you want to be explicit about S3
    - **Custom path**: If you have specific routing requirements
    
    **The CLI will create:**
    - Type-safe API route with validation
    - Authentication middleware (ready to customize)
    - Support for multiple upload types (images, documents)
    - Proper error handling and responses
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Component Generation
    
    ```
    ? Generate example upload page?
    ❯ Yes, create app/upload/page.tsx with full example
      Yes, just add components to components/ui/
      No, I'll build my own
    ```
    
    **Choose based on your needs:**
    
    **Full example page** - Best for:
    - Learning how the library works
    - Quick prototyping and testing
    - Getting a working demo immediately
    
    **Components only** - Best for:
    - Adding uploads to existing pages
    - Custom UI integration
    - Building your own demo
    
    **No components** - Best for:
    - Experienced developers
    - Custom implementation requirements
    - API-only usage
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### File Generation & Installation
    
    ```
    🛠️ Generating files...
    
    ✨ Created files:
      ├── app/api/upload/route.ts        # Type-safe API endpoint
      ├── app/upload/page.tsx            # Demo upload page
      ├── components/ui/upload-button.tsx # Simple upload button
      ├── components/ui/upload-dropzone.tsx # Drag & drop component
      ├── lib/upload-client.ts           # Type-safe client
      └── .env.example                   # Environment template
    
    📦 Installing dependencies with pnpm...
      ✓ pushduck
      ✓ @aws-sdk/client-s3
      ✓ react-dropzone
