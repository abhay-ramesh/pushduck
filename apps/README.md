# Apps

ðŸ”§ **Internal development tools and utilities**

This directory contains applications that are part of the monorepo development workflow, not user-facing examples.

## Current Structure

### Documentation Legacy

- **Path**: `./docs-legacy/`
- **Description**: Archived Nextra-based documentation (being replaced by root-level `/docs`)
- **Status**: Deprecated, kept for reference during migration

### Development Tools

- **Path**: `./docu/`
- **Description**: Fumadocs development setup (work in progress)
- **Purpose**: Building modern documentation experience

## Apps vs Examples

- **`/apps`** â†’ Internal tooling, development aids, CI/CD helpers
- **`/examples`** â†’ User-facing, copy-paste ready projects
- **`/docs`** â†’ Main documentation (root level for discoverability)

This structure follows patterns from successful repositories like Next.js, React, and tRPC.
