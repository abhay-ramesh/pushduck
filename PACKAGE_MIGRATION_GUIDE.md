#### File Structure

```
OLD: packages/next-s3-uploader/

import { uploadRouter } from 'pushduck/server';
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues and Solutions

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|
| **User adoption slow** | High | Comprehensive migration docs, active support |
| **NPM name conflicts** | Medium | Reserve name early, have alternatives |
| **SEO impact** | Medium | Proper redirects, gradual transition |
| **Community confusion** | High | Clear communication, consistent messaging |
| **Breaking changes** | High | Maintain API compatibility |

### Rollback Plan

If migration faces serious issues:

1. Un-deprecate old package
2. Continue development on both packages temporarily
3. Extend transition timeline
4. Gather more community feedback

---

## Success Metrics

### Migration Goals

- [ ] **90%+ user migration within 6 months**
- [ ] **Maintain/improve GitHub stars**
- [ ] **Zero critical migration issues**
- [ ] **Positive community feedback**
- [ ] **Improved brand recognition**

### Key Performance Indicators

- NPM download trends
- GitHub engagement metrics
- Website traffic and conversion
- Community support ticket volume
- User satisfaction surveys

---

## Resources and Tools

### Automation Scripts

- Migration helper scripts
- Automated testing for both packages
- Documentation generation
- Analytics dashboards

### Communication Templates

- Email templates for existing users
- Social media announcement templates
- Press release template
- FAQ responses

---

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Considerations:**

- Once deprecated, package cannot be un-deprecated easily
- NPM package names cannot be transferred between users
- Domain changes affect SEO significantly
- Community trust is paramount during transitions

‚úÖ **Best Practices:**

- Maintain API compatibility during transition
- Over-communicate rather than under-communicate  
- Provide multiple migration paths
- Keep old package functional during transition
- Monitor and respond to community feedback actively

---

*This migration guide should be updated as the process progresses. Each completed item should be marked with a ‚úÖ and dated.*
