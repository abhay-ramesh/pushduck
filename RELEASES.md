# 🚀 Release Process

We've simplified our release process to match popular repositories like **better-auth** and **tRPC**.

## Quick Release

```bash
# For patch releases (bug fixes)
pnpm release:patch

# For minor releases (new features)  
pnpm release:minor

# For major releases (breaking changes)
pnpm release:major
```

## What Happens

1. **Version bump** - Updates package.json versions in both packages
2. **Git tag** - Creates and pushes a git tag  
3. **GitHub Release** - Automatically creates a release with:
   - ✨ **Auto-generated release notes** (like better-auth)
   - 📝 **"What's Changed"** section
   - 👥 **"New Contributors"** section  
   - 🎉 **Reactions** (+1, ❤️, 🚀)
4. **NPM Publish** - Publishes both packages to NPM

## Manual Steps (if needed)

```bash
# 1. Version the packages
cd packages/pushduck && npm version patch
cd packages/cli && npm version patch

# 2. Push tags
git push && git push --tags

# 3. Publish manually (if automation fails)
cd packages/pushduck && npm publish
cd packages/cli && npm publish
```

## Why This Approach?

- ✅ **Simple** - No complex changeset management
- ✅ **Popular** - Same pattern as better-auth, tRPC, and others
- ✅ **Automatic** - Rich release notes generated by GitHub
- ✅ **Fast** - No extra tooling or configuration needed

## GitHub Release Notes

Our releases automatically include:

```markdown
## What's Changed
* Add new feature X by @user in #123
* Fix bug Y by @user in #124

## New Contributors  
* @newuser made their first contribution in #125

**Full Changelog**: v1.0.0...v1.1.0
```

Just like the repos you know and love! 🎉
