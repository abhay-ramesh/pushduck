# Namespace Reservation Strategy: pushduck + @pushduck/*

## 🎯 **Strategic Approach: Start Simple, Reserve Future**

Your strategy is **perfect** for a professional package migration:

1. **Launch**: Simple `pushduck` package for immediate migration
2. **Reserve**: `@pushduck/*` scope for future expansion
3. **Evolve**: Transition to scoped packages when ready

## 📦 **Phase 1: Launch `pushduck` Package**

### **Package Configuration**

```json
{
  "name": "pushduck",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Simple S3 file uploads for Next.js (successor to next-s3-uploader)",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/abhay-ramesh/pushduck.git"
  },
  "homepage": "https://pushduck.dev",
  "keywords": [
    "nextjs", "s3", "upload", "react", "aws", "pushduck",
    "next-s3-uploader-successor", "file-upload"
  ]
}
```

### **Migration Path**

```bash
# OLD
npm install next-s3-uploader

# NEW
npm install pushduck
```

### **Import Path**

```typescript
// OLD
import { uploadRouter } from 'next-s3-uploader/server';

// NEW
import { uploadRouter } from 'pushduck/server';
```

## 🏗️ **Phase 2: Reserve @pushduck Scope**

### **Step 1: Create NPM Organization**

1. **Visit**: <https://www.npmjs.com/org/create>
2. **Create organization**: `pushduck`
3. **Result**: You now control the entire `@pushduck/*` namespace

### **Step 2: Reserve Key Package Names**

Create placeholder packages to reserve important names:

#### **@pushduck/core** (Future main package)

```json
{
  "name": "@pushduck/core",
  "version": "0.0.1-reserved",
  "description": "Reserved package name for pushduck ecosystem",
  "private": false,
  "main": "./reserved.js"
}
```

#### **@pushduck/cli** (Future CLI)

```json
{
  "name": "@pushduck/cli", 
  "version": "0.0.1-reserved",
  "description": "Reserved package name for pushduck CLI tools",
  "private": false,
  "main": "./reserved.js"
}
```

#### **@pushduck/react** (Future React components)

```json
{
  "name": "@pushduck/react",
  "version": "0.0.1-reserved", 
  "description": "Reserved package name for pushduck React components",
  "private": false,
  "main": "./reserved.js"
}
```

### **Step 3: Create Reservation Script**

Create a simple `reserved.js` file for all placeholder packages:

```javascript
// reserved.js
console.log(`
🦆 This package name is reserved for the pushduck ecosystem.

The main package is currently available as: pushduck
Visit: https://pushduck.dev

This scoped package will be available in a future release.
`);

module.exports = {
  reserved: true,
  message: "This package name is reserved for pushduck ecosystem",
  mainPackage: "pushduck",
  website: "https://pushduck.dev"
};
```

## 🚀 **Publishing Strategy**

### **Immediate Actions**

1. **Publish main package:**

```bash
cd packages/next-s3-uploader  # rename to pushduck
# Update package.json name to "pushduck"
pnpm build
pnpm publish
```

2. **Create NPM organization:**

```bash
# Visit https://www.npmjs.com/org/create
# Create organization: pushduck
```

3. **Reserve scoped packages:**

```bash
# Create temporary directory for reservations
mkdir -p /tmp/pushduck-reservations
cd /tmp/pushduck-reservations

# Reserve @pushduck/core
mkdir core && cd core
npm init --scope=@pushduck --yes
# Update package.json with reservation details
npm publish --access public

# Repeat for other packages...
```

## 📊 **Package Name Portfolio**

### **Active Packages**

- ✅ `pushduck` - Main package (immediate use)
- ✅ `create-pushduck` - CLI package (or keep current name initially)

### **Reserved Packages**

- 🔒 `@pushduck/core` - Future main package
- 🔒 `@pushduck/cli` - Future CLI
- 🔒 `@pushduck/react` - Future React components
- 🔒 `@pushduck/vue` - Future Vue components
- 🔒 `@pushduck/integrations` - Future integrations
- 🔒 `@pushduck/providers` - Future cloud providers
- 🔒 `@pushduck/plugins` - Future plugins

## 🔄 **Future Migration Path**

### **Phase 3: Transition to Scoped (6-12 months later)**

When ready to transition to professional scoped packages:

1. **Publish real scoped packages:**

```bash
# Publish @pushduck/core with real functionality
npm publish @pushduck/core@1.0.0 --access public
```

2. **Deprecate simple package:**

```bash
npm deprecate pushduck "Migrated to @pushduck/core for better organization"
```

3. **Transition users gradually:**

```typescript
// In pushduck package
console.log(`
📦 pushduck is transitioning to @pushduck/core

For new projects, use:
  npm install @pushduck/core

Current installation continues to work.
Migration guide: https://pushduck.dev/migration-to-scoped
`);
```

## ⚠️ **Important Considerations**

### **NPM Policies**

- **No squatting**: Reserved packages should have basic functionality
- **Meaningful content**: Include proper README and package description
- **Active maintenance**: Don't abandon reserved packages

### **Best Practices**

- **Clear messaging**: Make it obvious these are reservations
- **Proper versioning**: Use `0.0.1-reserved` format
- **Documentation**: Point to main package and roadmap

### **Legal/Ethical**

- **Good faith**: Only reserve names you plan to use
- **Community benefit**: Don't block names others might need
- **Transparency**: Be open about reservation strategy

## 🎯 **Recommended Reservation List**

### **Core Packages** (Reserve immediately)

- `@pushduck/core` - Main library
- `@pushduck/cli` - CLI tools
- `@pushduck/types` - TypeScript definitions

### **Framework Packages** (Reserve soon)

- `@pushduck/react` - React components
- `@pushduck/vue` - Vue components  
- `@pushduck/svelte` - Svelte components

### **Integration Packages** (Reserve later)

- `@pushduck/next` - Next.js specific features
- `@pushduck/nuxt` - Nuxt.js integration
- `@pushduck/providers` - Cloud provider integrations

### **Utility Packages** (Optional)

- `@pushduck/utils` - Utility functions
- `@pushduck/plugins` - Plugin system
- `@pushduck/dev` - Development tools
